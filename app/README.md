**A calendar app for [ownCloud](https://owncloud.org).**  

This is the new calendar app that has replaced the [old calendar app](https://github.com/owncloudarchive/calendar) with ownCloud 9.0, and is only the frontend for the new CalDAV-Backend which has moved into the [ownCloud Core](https://github.com/owncloud/core).
